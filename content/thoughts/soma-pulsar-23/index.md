## One of the stars

Definitely one of the stars on this year Superbooth was SOMA Laboratory with their super cool drum machine [Pulsar 23](https://somasynths.com/pulsar-23/). And the highlight for me was when Vlad presented it in a live demo.

## Eurorack + Circuit bending 

There are 125 patchpoints available for e.g. Eurorack integration, but he also puts lots of connections on the outside which are normally only available if you would open the box. So you have access to capacitors etc. for additional modifications! 

THATs a very creative approach. Respect.

## Prototype performance

There is also a nice performance available on their prototype Pulsar.
